# STAR
Selectively Traversed Accumulation Rules

This is the repository for "STAR: A general interactive framework for FDR control under structural constraints". Several movies are included for illustration. (1) naiveconvex.gif and gamconvex.gif are movies for Section 4 (convex region detection). The former uses the canonical score and the latter uses the GAM-assisted score; (2) naivetree.gif and isotree.gif are movies for Section 5 (hierarchical testing). The former uses the canonical score and the latter uses the isotonic-regression-assisted score; (4) DAG_strong.gif and DAG_weak.gif are movies for Section 6 (testing on DAGs). The former considers the strong heredity principle and the latter considers the weak heredity principle. Both movies use the canonical score.
